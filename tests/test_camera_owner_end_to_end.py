End-to-end test for camera ownership flow.
This test verifies the complete flow:
1. Player places a camera
2. Server creates block_data with owner
3. Server creates camera_cube with owner
4. Server sends CAMERAS_LIST with owner field
5. Client filters cameras by owner
6. Client shows notification about owned cameras
