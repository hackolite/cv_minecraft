Test camera placement with owner tracking - Integration test.
This test verifies that when a player places a camera block:
1. The owner field is set correctly in block_data
2. The owner field is set correctly in camera_cube
3. The camera appears in the cameras list with correct owner
4. The client would be notified about their owned cameras
