"""
Test to verify that the model has local_player_cube attribute.

This test validates the fix for the issue:
"l'utilisateur tourne autour de la brick camera mais depuis la brick camera, 
on ne voit pas cet utilisateur originel"

The fix ensures that:
1. EnhancedClientModel has a local_player_cube attribute
2. create_local_player() method sets model.local_player_cube
3. The local player is accessible from camera cube windows
