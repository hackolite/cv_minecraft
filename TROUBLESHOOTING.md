# Troubleshooting 3D Visibility Issues

## Issue: "No blocks visible in the client"

This was the main issue addressed in this fix: "probleme de visibilité 3D coté client"

### Root Causes & Solutions:

#### 1. **Chunked World Data Not Handled**
- **Problem**: Server sends large worlds (>500 blocks) in chunks, but client only handled single `world_data` messages
- **Solution**: ✅ **FIXED** - Client now handles `world_chunk` and `world_complete` messages
- **Verification**: Run `python3 verify_fix.py` - should show "22 chunks" for a 64x64 world

#### 2. **Missing Depth Testing**
- **Problem**: 3D blocks weren't rendering with proper depth
- **Solution**: ✅ **FIXED** - Added `render.setDepthTest(True)` and `render.setDepthWrite(True)`
- **Result**: Blocks now render with correct 3D depth and visibility

#### 3. **Camera Setup Issues**
- **Problem**: Camera not configured for proper 3D perspective
- **Solution**: ✅ **FIXED** - Added proper `PerspectiveLens` with FOV 70°, near/far planes
- **Result**: Proper 3D viewing of the block world

## Quick Diagnostics

### 1. Test Server Connection
```bash
python3 verify_fix.py
```
Should show:
- ✅ Connected to server  
- ✅ 10,729+ blocks received in chunks
- ✅ All tests passed

### 2. Test 3D Rendering
```bash
python3 test_3d_rendering.py
```
Should show:
- ✅ 100% rendering success rate
- ✅ Valid 3D world bounds (64×41×64)
- ✅ Multiple block types detected

### 3. Manual Client Test
```bash
# Start server (one terminal)
python3 server.py

# Start client (another terminal)  
python3 client.py
```
Controls in client:
- **WASD**: Move around
- **Space/C**: Up/Down
- **Arrow keys**: Look around
- **R**: Request world data
- **T**: Test add block

## Expected Results

After the fix, you should see:
1. **Connection established** immediately
2. **Blocks loading in chunks** (status text shows progress)  
3. **Colored 3D blocks** visible in the world
4. **Smooth camera movement** with WASD controls
5. **Proper 3D depth** - blocks behind others are hidden correctly

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Check dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Verify server is running**: Should show "Server started on ws://localhost:8765"
3. **Check for error messages**: Both server and client terminals
4. **Test with headless mode**: The tests should pass even without a display

## Performance Notes

- World generation creates 39K+ blocks total
- Only ~10K visible blocks are sent to client (within 50-block radius)
- Data is chunked in 500-block pieces for manageable transfer
- Expected load time: 2-3 seconds for full world data
