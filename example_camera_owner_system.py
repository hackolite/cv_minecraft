Example: Camera Block User Object System
=========================================

This example demonstrates the new camera block ownership and recording system.

Features demonstrated:
1. Camera blocks track their owner (player who placed them)
2. Each camera block creates a user/cube object
3. Players can control recording for owned cameras with F1/F2/F3
4. Timestamps synchronize multi-camera recordings

    For Players:
    -----------
    1. Select camera block (inventory slot 5)
    2. Place camera blocks where you want to record
    3. Use F1/F2/F3 to start/stop recording for each camera
    4. Recordings saved in separate directories with timestamps
    5. Use timestamps to sync videos in post-processing
    
    For Developers:
    --------------
    1. Camera blocks now have 'owner' field (player_id)
    2. Server creates Cube instances for player-placed cameras
    3. Camera cubes stored in server.camera_cubes dict
    4. Client tracks owned_cameras list from server responses
    5. Multiple GameRecorder instances per client (one per camera)
    6. Timestamp-based session naming for synchronization
    
    Key Files Modified:
    ------------------
    - server.py: Camera ownership, camera_cubes dict, cleanup
    - minecraft_client_fr.py: F1/F2/F3 bindings, camera recorders
    - protocol.py: Owner field in block data (create_block_data)
    - BLOCK_METADATA_SYSTEM.md: Documentation
    
    Testing:
    -------
    - tests/test_camera_owner.py: New owner field tests
    - tests/test_block_metadata.py: Updated for owner field
    - All tests pass with Xvfb virtual display
