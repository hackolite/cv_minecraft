Demonstration: 1x1x1 Cube Traversal Fix
======================================

This script demonstrates that the player cube traversal issue has been fixed.
The player is now correctly represented as a 1x1x1 cube in both visual rendering
and collision detection, preventing unwanted traversal through blocks.

Problem: User reported "je traverse toujours" (I always pass through) when 
the player should be a 1x1x1 cube.

Solution: Made player dimensions consistent:
- Visual: 1x1x1 cube (size=0.5 half-size) 
- Collision: 1x1x1 cube (PLAYER_WIDTH=1.0, PLAYER_HEIGHT=1.0)

Run this script to see the collision detection working correctly.
