# Minecraft Username and Player Visibility - SOLUTION SUMMARY

## 🎯 Problems Addressed

### Issue 1: "add on windows, the user name"
**Problem**: Client didn't ask for or display user names properly on Windows

### Issue 2: "i don't see others players"  
**Problem**: Players couldn't see other players in the game

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 🔧 Username Input (Cross-Platform)
- **Windows**: Detects `USERNAME` environment variable
- **Unix/Linux**: Detects `USER`/`LOGNAME` environment variables
- **User Prompt**: "Enter your username (default: [system_username]): "
- **Validation**: Replaces spaces with underscores, limits to 32 characters
- **Graceful Handling**: Ctrl+C uses system default

### 🔧 Player Visibility System
- **Fixed Protocol Mismatch**: Client now sends delta-based movement updates
- **Player ID Communication**: Server includes player_id in world initialization
- **Self-Filtering**: Client properly filters out its own updates
- **Network Efficiency**: Movement/rotation thresholds prevent spam

### 🔧 Visual Enhancements
- **Name Labels**: 3D name labels appear above player cubes
- **Distance-Based**: Labels only show for nearby players
- **Real-Time Updates**: Names update as players move
