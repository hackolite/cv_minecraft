# Monolithic → Client-Server Architecture Conversion Guide

## Overview

This project has been successfully converted from a **monolithic architecture** (single-process game) to a **client-server architecture** for multiplayer support.

## Original Architecture (Monolithic)

The original `minecraft.py` contained everything in a single process:
- World generation and storage (`Model` class)
- Game physics and collision detection
- 3D rendering and OpenGL setup (`Window` class)
- Input handling (keyboard/mouse)
- Game loop and timing

**Problems with monolithic approach:**
- ❌ No multiplayer support
- ❌ All computation on client side
- ❌ No shared world state
- ❌ Single point of failure

## New Architecture (Client-Server)

### 🖥️ Server (`server.py`)

**Responsibilities:**
- **World Management**: Authoritative world state with `GameWorld` class
- **Client Connections**: WebSocket server handling multiple clients
- **Game Logic**: Block placement/destruction, collision detection
- **State Synchronization**: Broadcasting updates to all clients
- **Player Management**: Tracking player positions and actions

**Key Components:**
- `GameWorld`: Manages blocks, world generation, hit testing
- `MinecraftServer`: Handles WebSocket connections and message routing
- **Chunked World Loading**: Sends world data in 16x16 chunks to prevent message size issues

### 🎮 Client (`client.py`)

**Responsibilities:**
- **Rendering**: 3D graphics with Pyglet/OpenGL
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard/mouse input processing
- **Network Communication**: WebSocket client connecting to server
- **Local Prediction**: Smooth movement while waiting for server confirmation

**Key Components:**
- `ClientModel`: Local copy of world state for rendering
- `NetworkClient`: Handles server communication in separate thread
- `Window`: Pyglet window with rendering and input handling

### 📡 Protocol (`protocol.py`)

**Communication Protocol:**
- **Message Types**: Structured enum-based message system
- **JSON Serialization**: All messages sent as JSON over WebSocket
- **Player State**: Position, rotation, movement synchronization
- **Block Updates**: Real-time block placement/destruction
- **World Chunks**: Efficient world data transmission

## Conversion Process

### 1. Extract Server Logic
```python
# From minecraft.py Model class → server.py GameWorld class
class GameWorld:
    def __init__(self):
        self.world = {}  # Block storage
        self.sectors = {}  # Spatial indexing
        self._initialize_world()  # World generation
```

### 2. Create Communication Protocol
```python
# protocol.py - Message system
class MessageType(Enum):
    PLAYER_JOIN = "player_join"
    PLAYER_MOVE = "player_move"
    BLOCK_PLACE = "block_place"
    WORLD_UPDATE = "world_update"
    # ... etc
```

### 3. Implement WebSocket Server
```python
# server.py - Multi-client support
async def handle_client(self, websocket, path):
    player_id = await self.register_client(websocket)
    async for message_str in websocket:
        message = Message.from_json(message_str)
        await self.handle_client_message(player_id, message)
```

### 4. Convert Client to Network-Aware
```python
# client.py - Network client
class NetworkClient:
    async def _connect_to_server(self):
        self.websocket = await websockets.connect(self.server_url)
        # Handle incoming messages...
```

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Multiplayer Support
- Multiple clients can connect simultaneously
- Real-time player movement synchronization
- Shared world state across all clients

### ✅ Efficient World Loading
- **Problem**: Sending entire world (128x128 blocks) exceeded WebSocket message limits
- **Solution**: Chunked loading - world sent in 16x16 chunks
- **Result**: Fast initial connection, reduced memory usage

### ✅ Real-time Block Updates
- Block placement/destruction synchronized instantly
- Authoritative server prevents conflicts
- Optimistic client-side prediction for responsiveness

### ✅ Robust Connection Handling
- Graceful client disconnection
- Automatic cleanup of disconnected players
- Error handling and reconnection support

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Chunked World Transmission
```python
# Instead of sending entire world at once:
def get_world_chunk(self, chunk_x, chunk_z, chunk_size=16):
    # Send only 16x16 block sections
```

### 2. Position Update Throttling
```python
# Client sends position updates at 10 FPS instead of 60 FPS
if time.time() - self._last_position_update > 0.1:
    self._send_position_update()
```

### 3. Asynchronous Message Handling
```python
# Non-blocking message processing
pyglet.clock.schedule_once(
    lambda dt, msg=message: self._handle_server_message(msg), 0
)
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ Single Client Connection
- Server starts successfully on localhost:8765
- Client connects and receives world chunks
- Movement and block interaction work correctly

### ✅ Multi-Client Support
- 3 concurrent clients tested successfully
- Player movements synchronized across all clients
- 82 messages processed per client over 15 seconds
- No message loss or connection issues

### ✅ Stress Testing
```
Starting multi-client test...
Client 1: Connected! Received 82 messages
Client 2: Connected! Received 82 messages  
Client 3: Connected! Received 82 messages
Multi-client test completed!
```

## Files Overview

| File | Purpose | Size |
|------|---------|------|
| `server.py` | Game server with world management | ~400 lines |
| `client.py` | Multiplayer client with rendering | ~800 lines |
| `protocol.py` | Communication protocol definitions | ~200 lines |
| `minecraft.py` | Original monolithic version (preserved) | ~1000 lines |

## Usage

### Start Server
```bash
python3 server.py
# Output: Server started! Connect clients to ws://localhost:8765
```

### Connect Clients
```bash
python3 client.py  # Terminal 1
python3 client.py  # Terminal 2
python3 client.py  # Terminal 3 (etc.)
```

### Run Tests
```bash
python3 tests/test_connection.py     # Basic connectivity
python3 tests/test_multiplayer.py    # Multi-client simulation
```

## Benefits Achieved
