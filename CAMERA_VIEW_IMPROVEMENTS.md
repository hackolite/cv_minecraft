# Camera View Improvements

## Problem Statement
"am√©liore la vision du bloc camera, en positionnant la vue plus en avant, un peu plus haut et plus large."

(Improve camera block view by positioning the view more forward, slightly higher, and wider.)

## Solution Implemented

Three specific improvements have been made to the camera block view in `protocol.py`:

### 1. **Camera Positioned Higher** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
- **Before**: `camera_y += 0.6`
- **After**: `camera_y += 0.9`
- **Impact**: Camera view is now elevated 50% higher, providing a better vantage point

### 2. **Camera Positioned Forward** ‚û°Ô∏è
- **Before**: Camera positioned at the exact cube location
- **After**: Camera moved 1.5 blocks forward in the viewing direction
- **Implementation**: 
  ```python
  # Calculate forward direction vector based on rotation
  forward_distance = 1.5
  m = math.cos(math.radians(rotation_y))
  forward_x = math.sin(math.radians(rotation_x)) * m * forward_distance
  forward_z = -math.cos(math.radians(rotation_x)) * m * forward_distance
  
  camera_x += forward_x
  camera_z += forward_z
  ```
- **Impact**: Camera now shows more of what's ahead instead of just the immediate surroundings

### 3. **Wider Field of View** üìê
- **Before**: `fov=70.0`
- **After**: `fov=85.0`
- **Impact**: 21% wider viewing angle, allowing the camera to capture more of the scene

## Benefits

1. **Better Perspective**: Camera shows more of the environment ahead
2. **Improved Coverage**: Wider FOV captures more of the scene in a single view
3. **Enhanced Viewing Height**: Slightly elevated view reduces ground obstruction
4. **More Natural View**: Forward positioning creates a more natural camera angle

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_camera_view_improvements.py` that validates:
- ‚úÖ Camera height offset increased above 0.6
- ‚úÖ Camera positioned forward with forward distance calculation
- ‚úÖ FOV increased above 70.0
- ‚úÖ All three improvements present together

All existing camera tests continue to pass:
- ‚úÖ `test_camera_rendering_fix.py`
- ‚úÖ `test_camera_sees_all_players.py`
- ‚úÖ `test_camera_player_visibility.py`

## Files Modified

1. **protocol.py** - Modified `CubeWindow._render_world_from_camera()` method
   - Added forward positioning calculation
   - Increased height offset
   - Increased FOV parameter

2. **tests/test_camera_view_improvements.py** - New test file to validate improvements

## Minimal Changes Approach

The implementation follows minimal change principles:
- Only 18 lines of code changed in one method
- No changes to API or interface
- Backward compatible with all existing functionality
- All existing tests continue to pass
