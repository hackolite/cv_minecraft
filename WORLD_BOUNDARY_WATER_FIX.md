# World Boundary and Water Collision Fixes

## Problem Statement (French)
Original request: "Actuellement, les blocs d'eau (BlockType.WATER) n'ont pas de collision dans cv_minecraft, ce qui permet au joueur de traverser l'eau. Je souhaite que l'eau se comporte comme un bloc de grass (solide) : le joueur doit être bloqué sur l'eau comme sur un bloc grass."

Translation:
- Currently, water blocks have no collision, allowing players to pass through water
- Requirement: Water should behave like grass blocks (solid) - players must be blocked on water like on grass blocks

## Issues Fixed

### 1. World Boundary Protection
**Problem:** Players could move beyond the world boundaries (0 to WORLD_SIZE) and fall off the edge of the world.

**Solution:** Added boundary clamping in the collision resolution system:
- Modified `UnifiedCollisionManager` to accept `world_size` and `world_height` parameters
- Added `_clamp_to_world_bounds()` method to enforce boundaries
- Players are now clamped to valid positions within `[0.5, 127.5]` for X and Z axes (accounting for player width)
- Collision info properly reports when boundary collision occurs

**Files Modified:**
- `minecraft_physics.py`: Added world boundary constants and clamping logic

### 2. Water Block Collision Change
**Previous State:** Water blocks had no collision, allowing players to pass through water freely.

**New Requirement:** Water blocks should behave like grass blocks - solid with collision enabled.

**Solution:** Updated water block collision properties:
- Modified `get_block_collision()` in `server.py` to include water blocks as solid (removed from non-collision types)
- Water blocks now have `collision=True` in their block data
- Players are blocked by water blocks, same as grass or stone blocks

**Files Modified:**
- `server.py`: Updated `get_block_collision()` to return `True` for water blocks

## Technical Details

### Changes to `minecraft_physics.py`
1. Added world constants:
   ```python
   WORLD_SIZE = 128
   WORLD_HEIGHT = 256
   ```

2. Modified `UnifiedCollisionManager.__init__()`:
   - Added `world_size` and `world_height` parameters
   - Stores world boundaries for collision checking

3. Added `_clamp_to_world_bounds()` method:
   - Clamps X coordinate to `[PLAYER_WIDTH/2, world_size - PLAYER_WIDTH/2]`
   - Clamps Z coordinate to `[PLAYER_WIDTH/2, world_size - PLAYER_WIDTH/2]`
   - Clamps Y coordinate to `[0, world_height - PLAYER_HEIGHT]`

4. Modified `resolve_collision()`:
   - Calls `_clamp_to_world_bounds()` before collision detection
   - Reports collision on axes that were clamped

5. Updated wrapper functions to pass world size parameters:
   - `MinecraftCollisionDetector`
   - `get_collision_manager()`
   - `unified_check_collision()`

### Changes to `server.py`
1. Modified `get_block_collision()`:
   ```python
   # Before:
   non_collision_types = {BlockType.AIR, BlockType.WATER}
   
   # After (water is now solid):
   non_collision_types = {BlockType.AIR}
   ```

## Testing

### New Test File
Created `tests/test_world_boundary_water.py` with comprehensive tests:
- `test_water_has_collision()`: Verifies water blocks have collision enabled
- `test_world_boundary_prevents_falling()`: Tests all world boundaries (X+, X-, Z+, Z-)
- `test_player_on_water_cannot_sink()`: Verifies players are blocked by water blocks

### Updated Test Files
Updated `tests/test_block_metadata.py`:
- Changed assertions to expect `collision=True` for water blocks
- All tests pass with the new behavior

Updated `tests/test_world_boundary_water.py`:
- Renamed `test_water_has_no_collision()` to `test_water_has_collision()`
- Renamed `test_player_on_water_does_not_sink()` to `test_player_on_water_cannot_sink()`
- Updated assertions to expect water to block player movement
- All tests pass with the new behavior

### Test Results
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ World boundary collision tests
- ✅ Water collision tests  
- ✅ Block metadata tests
- ✅ Simple collision system tests
- ✅ Unified collision API tests
- ✅ Player collision tests
- ✅ Collision fix verification tests

## Demonstration

Created `demo_world_boundary_water_fix.py` to demonstrate the fixes:
- Shows world boundary protection in action
- Demonstrates water block behavior
- Compares water vs solid block collision

Run with:
```bash
python demo_world_boundary_water_fix.py
```

## Backward Compatibility

The changes maintain backward compatibility for most features:
- World size parameters have default values (WORLD_SIZE=128, WORLD_HEIGHT=256)
- Existing code that doesn't pass world size will use defaults
- **Note:** Water block behavior has changed - water is now solid (collision=True) instead of passable (collision=False)
  - This may affect existing gameplay where players could previously swim through water
  - Water now behaves identically to grass, stone, and other solid blocks

## Summary

Both issues have been successfully resolved:
1. ✅ Players cannot fall off the edge of the world - they are safely clamped within boundaries
2. ✅ Water blocks are now solid - players stand on water instead of passing through it (water behaves like grass)

The fixes are minimal, focused, and maintain compatibility with existing code while solving the reported problems.
